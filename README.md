## üë§ About the Author
This project was developed by Aashman Jeremias Dcosta during an internship at the Human Touch Foundation. The internship provided a unique opportunity to contribute to a cause dedicated to empowering youth and addressing critical social issues. Working closely with the foundation, I was able to apply and expand my skills in web development, particularly in using React and Tailwind CSS. This project reflects the foundation's mission and my commitment to leveraging technology for social good.

## üåü Internship Experience
During my internship at the Human Touch Foundation, I had the privilege of working on this website project. It was a rewarding experience that allowed me to combine my passion for web development with a meaningful cause. Under the guidance of the foundation's team, I learned about the challenges faced by marginalized communities and the impactful work done by the foundation to address these issues.

The project involved creating a dynamic and responsive website that effectively communicates the foundation's mission, services, and achievements. I focused on ensuring the site was user-friendly, visually appealing, and informative. The experience not only enhanced my technical skills but also deepened my understanding of the importance of community engagement and support.

Working at the Human Touch Foundation has been a transformative experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to their mission of creating a healthier, more inclusive society.
